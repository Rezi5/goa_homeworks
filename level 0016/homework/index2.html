    on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643[a]) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, 
    a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire.[28] <strong>His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child;

    the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Aysc

     "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn 
    them and the house over them."
